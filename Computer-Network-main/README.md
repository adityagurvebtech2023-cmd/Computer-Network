# Computer-Network  
A collection of practical lab assignments for the “Computer Networks” course.

## 🧑‍💻 Author  
**Aditya Gurve**  
B.Tech (CSE Honours), Data Science

Each folder (“practical_1”, “practical_2”, …) corresponds to a lab exercise in the Computer Networks course.

## 🎯 Purpose  
This repository serves to:  
- Document and implement a series of practical experiments on fundamental computer network concepts.  
- Provide clean, well-structured C code (100% C language) as required by the course.  
- Exhibit code organisation and readability in a learning environment.

## ✅ What's Included  
- C source code files for each practical / lab.  
- Project structure with separate directories for each session.  
- (Optionally) Sample inputs/outputs or screenshots illustrating expected behaviour.

## 🚀 How to Run a Practical  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShreyaliDongre/Computer-Network.git
   cd Computer-Network/practical_X
````

Replace `practical_X` with the desired lab folder (e.g., `practical_3`).

2. Compile the C file(s):

   ```bash
   gcc –o practical_X practical_X.c
   ```

   (Adjust filenames as needed.)

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./practical_X
   ```

4. Review the output and compare with expected results / lab manual.

## 🧪 Topics Covered

Typical network-programming or networking concepts that may be addressed include:

* Socket programming (TCP/UDP)
* Protocol simulation and analysis
* Packet handling / framing / error detection
* Network layers and routing logic
* … etc.

## 📚 Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of C programming.
* A Unix-like (Linux/macOS) or Windows environment with a C compiler (`gcc`).
* Familiarity with basic computer networks (OSI model, TCP/IP stack) is beneficial.

## 📝 Notes & Tips

* Ensure your compiler flags (e.g., `-Wall -Wextra`) are enabled to catch warnings.
* Comments in the code should help you understand the logic — feel free to annotate further.
* If you modify or extend any practical, update this README or add a note in the folder’s `README.txt`.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is primarily a personal academic project, but if you’d like to suggest improvements (better documentation, additional network scenarios, bug fixes), feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
